    Lonnie Allgood's Dreams for Kids is a passionate and committed organization in helping kids reach their dreams in life.
</p>
<p>
    Our mission is to help build a child's character by giving them the tools they need to believe in them and respect others.
</p>
<p>
    Through interaction with current and former professional athletes as mentors we want children to understand the importance of education and inspire them to become great people in society.
</p>
<p>
    Dare to Dream is designed to reach adolescents form ages 7 to 18 years of age, when children are more vulnerable to peer pressure.
</p>
<p>
    It is an educational support program that concentrates on providing the maturing adolescent with valuable information about life experiences. Our program utilizes the experience and insight of professional athletes, entertainers, business and community leaders as role models for the youth of today.
