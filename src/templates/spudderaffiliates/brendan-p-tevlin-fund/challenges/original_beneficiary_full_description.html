<p>The Brendan Tevlin RAK Challenge is the result of a family and communities refusal to let a <a href="http://goo.gl/j7fPqJ" target="_blank">tragedy</a> tarnish the life of an amazing young man.  Much of the strength come from Brendan himself who lived his life by the motto “<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fgroups%2F713200362058899%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNF573gxtTRkbVk1NIuyZJ5R3qMXMw" target="_blank">Good Vibes & Easy Living</a>”.</p>

<p>As a gifted athlete Brendan had a very strong love of sports making Spudder the ideal platform to host the challenge. Yet Brendan was more than just a good athlete, more than a bagpiper, more than an excellent student because Brendan lived his life doing Random Acts of Kindness. Thus the Brendan P. Tevlin RAK Challenge was born.</p>

<p>The main mission of the Brendan P. Tevlin RAK Challenge is to increase awareness and inspire the young athletes, adults and everyone else to experience “Good Vibes and Easy Living” through Random Acts of Kindness. There is no better way for sports organizations to raise money then through doing a Random Act of Kindness.</p>

<p>The Brendan P Tevlin Fund will continue this mission long after the immediate result of the challenge have subsided. To assure this happens Spudder will be donating 50% the standard 2% transaction fee collected from every Brendan P. Tevlin RAK Challenge donation made to organizations other than the Brendan P. Tevlin Fund. God Bless Brendan and  “Good Vibes & Easy Living”.<p>
