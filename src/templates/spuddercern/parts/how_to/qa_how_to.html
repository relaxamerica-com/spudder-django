    <h4>Your Progress in QA Testing</h4>
    <p><b><i>Alert! Filler text below!!</i></b></p>
    <p>Here we can display a progress report for students involved in the project, with basic details.</p>
    <p>My thinking is that we could have some stats like "total tasks completed" and such.</p>
    {% else %}
    <h4>Overview of QA Testing Project</h4>
    <p>There are only a very limited number of people accepted as QA testers, because you will receive the hands on training of our Quality Assurance Manager. This will teach you to become a true <a href="http://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=Quality+Assurance&l=&radius=100">Quality Assurance Professional</a>.</p>
    <p><b>How do I earn Points?</b> If accepted into the program there will be a listing of User Stories that you can choose to test. Each user story will have a set number of points that can be earned if you choose to test it. (See more about User Stories and testing in Details.)</p>
    <p><b>Why do I want to earn Points?</b> CERN is <b>all about</b> earning points. CERN points determine the <a href="/cern/compensation">rate you earn</a> on CERN, they can be <a href="/cern/redeem_points">redeemed for cash</a>, and most important they <a href="/cern/after_college">improve your Linkedin Profile</a>.</p>    {% endif %}

    <h4>Details on QA Testing</h4>
    <p><b>QA Testing</b> involves selecting a "user story" and taking “Screen Shots” of you acting as the user who performs the tasks described in the user story. You will learn to become a QA Professional by taking detailed notes about any <b>issues</b> you encounter when performing the task described in the user story that you choose.</p>
    <p><b>What is a User Story?</b> - User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature, that are told from the perspective of the person who wants to use the new feature, usually a user or customer of the system.</p>
    <p>An example user story might be: <i>As a Student, I want to be able to Review a list of Available User Stories and their Points Value so that I can choose which ones I want to Test. - Value 100 PTs</i></p>
    <p>See the Walkthrough tab for a video of someone actually testing a user story, so that you know exactly what to expect.</p>
    <p>There are only a very limited number of people accepted as QA testers, because you will be able to receive the hands on training of our Quality assurance manager. This will teach you to become a true Quality Assurance Professional.</p>
    <p><b>How can I use these skills after school?</b> <a href="http://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=Quality+Assurance&l=&radius=100">Search various QA Positions</a></p>
