                            At Spudder a Club is an entity that uses Spudder® to fundraise for a Team and gives them easy-to-use marketplace tools. Spudder® uses the most trusted ecommerce provider in the world, AMAZON®, to facilitate these transactions. So not only can you trust that the donation happens in a safe and secure transaction, but your donation will be recorded in your AMAZON® account and your Spudder® account for record keeping purposes.

                        <h4>What can Clubs do?</h4>
                        <p>Clubs can create their own SEO advertising mobile and web profiles. These profiles are public facing pages, so not only are they accessible in the form of banner links on the Team pages that you associate, but they will drive traffic from the entire internet.</p>
                        <p>There are a number of ways to help associated local Teams on Spudder including: fundraising, sponsorship offers, marketplace (for items like tickets, clothes and souvenirs) and many more.</p>
                        <p>Spudder® is a powerful marketing tool for local businesses. All the proceeds (less a small standard processing fee) goes directly back to the place it matters most: your local community! Thus aiding the kids in your home town.</p>
