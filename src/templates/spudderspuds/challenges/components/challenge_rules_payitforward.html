<p>Chances are you've had your social media reputation put to the test by receiving a challenge from a friend or family member or maybe you just want to start a new chain of challenges by being the first!</p>

<p>The rules of the ‘Pay it Forward’ Challenge are simple.</p>

<p>There are three ways you can be a rock star for the Pay it Forward Challenge</p>

<ol>
    <li>Accept the challenge to help spread awareness only</li>
    <li>Accept the challenge to spread awareness and pledge to the cause</li>
    <li>Pledge to the cause only</li>
</ol>

<p>We'll cover each below in detail.</p>



<h4 class="text-primary">Accept the Challenge Only</h4>

<p>Ready to do the Pay It Forward Challenge for a good cause? Excellent! Anyone can simply accept this challenge to help the organization raise funds.</p>

<p>Keep in mind the following:</p>

<p>Every person who accepts the challenge gets to set for whom they would like to raise pledges for... Of course, Spudder courtesy reflects first responding to your challenger then creating a separate new challenge for the cause of your choice. What makes this challenge unique is your group will be raising money not for your own group but will be “Paying It Forward” to the next group.</p>

<p>If you have been challenged by someone else you should see the video of the person who challenged you doing the act they were challenged to do. They will then ‘Call-You-Out’ to do a challenge for a specific group of their choice.</p>

<p>It’s not uncommon for different teams within the same organization or school to challenge each other.</p>


<h4 class="text-primary">Accept and Pledge</h4>

<p>Just like "Accept Only" above you have the ability to accept the challenge by recording yourself doing the random Act of Kindness. This selection also allows you to be a true MVP (Most Valuable Partner) for those who challenge you by also donating to their cause.</p>

<p>Here's what you need to know:</p>

<p>Upon completing the challenge, you will be able to set the amount that you wish to pledge. It can be as little or as much as you like.</p>

<p>Spudder allows you to raise donations for any organization, but only approved organizations will be allowed to collect the pledges through Spudder. In order to collect the pledges the organizations are required to obtain a valid Stripe Credit Card Processing account - which is super easy and takes 5 minutes to set up.</p>

<p>Once the Organization is approved, Spudder notifies the you that the organization is approved and will request you to honor your Pledge (which you will do since you're an MVP!)</p>

<p>If the Organization is already Spudder approved then the user will be given the chance to honor the pledge immediately.</p>



<h4 class="text-primary">Pledge Only</h4>

<p>This is just like "Accept Only" above but instead of taking a delicious pie to the face you are instead putting your money where your mouth is by donating.</p>

<p>If you Pledge only you do not need to create a video, instead you will immediately be able to set the amount that you wish to pledge.</p>

<p>Remember:  Spudder allows you to raise donations for any organization, but only approved organizations will be allowed to collect the pledges through Spudder. In order to collect the pledges the organizations are required to obtain a valid Stripe Credit Card Processing account - which is super easy and takes 5 minutes to set up.</p>

<p>Once the Organization is approved, Spudder notifies you that the organization is approved and will sent you a link to honor your Pledge (which you will do since you're an MVP!)</p>

<p>If the Organization is already Spudder approved then you can immediately make your donation through Spudder.</p>
